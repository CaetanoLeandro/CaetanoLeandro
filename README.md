- 👀 I’m interested in,
I am a 3rd semester student in the Bachelor of Information Systems course, Unisinos.

I know I don't have a lot of experience in the area, but I have a great ability to learn fast. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning, Java and JS.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on,
With what I'm learning, since, at the moment, I don't have a great deal of experience...
